# GRIT
On Linux or OSX we don't have the luxury of the Windows GUI (wingrit) to play with. 

Instead we have an extremely powerful command line tool. The command line functionally has like 100 different options. So this page will contain a list of commands I find useful and what I actually used.

If you are interested in the official manual you can view that here: http://www.coranac.com/man/grit/html/index.htm

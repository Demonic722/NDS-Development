# Why this is important

At some point in history, some of the NDS tools that were available today wont be in a few years. Through my period of learning more about developing on the NDS, i've found an unfortunate amount of broken links and dead downloads. So to preserve history and provide anyone with an interest in developing with them, this section will include tools I find useful.

Because 99% of these tools are released for public homebrew use, I'll try to ensure that I'm not condoning piracy. If I do step on someones feet, please notify me and I'll remove it asap.

# NDS Development Tools

### GRIT - GBA Raster Image Transmogrifier
Grit is this nice software that has a bunch of image/map handling abilites. Looks like the last time this was updated was in 2010 but fortunately the project developer still provides links to different versions: http://www.coranac.com/projects/#grit

Please notice, GRIT is actually pre-installed and ready to go with DevKitPro. Read the grit [README.md](grit/README.md) for more

You can learn how to use GRIT with the [official manual](http://www.coranac.com/man/grit/html/index.htm) but I've also put together a list of commands in the [/grit](grit/README.md) folder.

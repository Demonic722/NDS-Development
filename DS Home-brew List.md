# DS Home-brew List
This page will be an active collection of DS projects on the web (old and new). The requirement to get on this page though is that the project source has to be included. That way we can all learn from each other.

Hit me up @kite0080 if you want your project to show up on this page.

1. 3 Mini Games (full source) - https://github.com/Thunderbolt26/nintendo_ds_game

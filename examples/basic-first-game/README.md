# Basic First Game
Everything we've learned from the first few examples has given us enough knowledge to create our first game. We'll be starting off with the `bitmap-sprite-movement` code and expanding it. If you are having a hard time understanding this code I suggest reading the README.md of `bitmap-sprite-movement`.

Specifically, we'll be using what we learned from `bitmap-sprite-movement` and `basic-sprite-collision` to create collection game. So the character will be able to collect coins and a scoreboard will update. It's endless and no real goal but challange yourself to improve it to a full game (maybe like snake?).

### Sprites

# Basic RTS
I'm pretty interested in getting an RTS together, so I'll be breaking up the development of it into multiple parts. The code, the sprites and the entire project is free to use for your own games! If you do develop something with it let me know, I'd love to spot light it!

#### [Part 1](./PART_1/) - selecting a house
When creating units for your forces usually a house of sorts is selected to display a menu and select which unit to start creating. In this example we have the ability to select a house and a menu appears.

#### Part 2 - creating units
Coming soon...

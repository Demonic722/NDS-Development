# NDS Game Development Topics
This repo is broken up into high level topics and each of those topics have it's own README.md that go into more detail. For example the Graphics examples have a total of 9 examples. Each of those 9 examples will have it's own README outlining new information about the code. So this truly is a great way to learn the DevKitPro SDK.

#### 1. [Graphics](/examples/Graphics/)
###### *(Novice - Moderate) - 9 Examples*

Here we will learn how to display a basic solid square on the screen to a full basic game in 9 different examples. Each example will have it's own tutorial outlining new code and different concepts for a full understanding of the basics of graphics on the NDS. I suggest starting off here if you are new to DevKitPro and NDS homebrew development.

#### 2. [Ray Casting](/examples/Ray_Casting/)
###### *(Advance) - working progress*

Here we will learn about an advance idea that can make your game look reall awesome with Ray Casting. Each example has a comprehensive outline of new code, concepts and equations. I truly think anyone can learn how to Ray Cast from these examples because of how much information I go into. If you are looking to take everything you've learned from the `Graphics` category and take it to the next level, Ray Casting is it!

#### 3. [Basic RTS](/examples/Basic-RTS/)
###### *(Advance) - working progress*

I'm pretty interested in getting an RTS together, so I'll be breaking up the development of it into multiple parts. The code, the sprites and the entire project is free to use for your own games! If you do develop something with it let me know, I'd love to spot light it!

# Ray Casting on NDS
I found a really awesome resource on [Ray Casting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting) with HTML5/JS Canvas. So much so that I think it's worth the effort to porting it to the NDS. This resouce by ncase, is interactive so go check it out before you start trying to understand each example. http://ncase.me/sight-and-light/

# Examples
The Ray cast examples by ncase are a collection of improved iterations. This includes a total of 8 different examples some of which I will port. Below are an outline of each

### Example_1 :octocat: Dev-ing :octocat:
This example shows off a basic hit detections on a single ray. This is a good starting point to understand the basics of Ray Casting. Move the stylus in any direction and watch the ray cast to various objects on the screen.
